# HR-Analytics-Data-Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using PowerBI)
## Project Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard is designed to monitor and analyze employee attrition across different departments (Sales, Research & Development, Human Resources). It helps HR teams identify key trends, employee demographics, and factors influencing attrition. The dashboards provide insights into employee count, attrition rate, average age, salary, tenure, education background, gender distribution, job roles, and salary slabs.

## Interpretation of Visualizations
1. Sales has the highest attrition rate (20.6%).
2. Low salary slabs (â‰¤5K) strongly linked with attrition.
3. 26â€“35 years employees leave the most.
4. Male attrition higher in Sales & R&D.
5. Education impact: Marketing & Life Sciences (Sales), Life Sciences & Medical (R&D).
6. Operational roles (Sales Execs, Lab Techs, HR Officers) face more attrition than senior roles.

## Conclusion & Recommendations
â€¢ Key Pain Points: High attrition in Sales & HR, younger employees (26â€“35), low salaries, and early tenure.
â€¢ Business Impact: Loss of trained employees, higher recruitment/training costs, productivity decline.
â€¢ Recommendations:
  1. Improve salary structure for entry-level roles.
  2. Implement career growth & development programs.
  3. Conduct employee engagement & satisfaction surveys.
  4. Provide mentorship & learning opportunities in first 3 years.
  5. Strengthen work-life balance policies in high-pressure roles.
