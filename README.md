# HR-Analytics-Data-Analysis(Interactive Dashboard creation using PowerBI)
## Project Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard is designed to monitor and analyze employee attrition across different departments (Sales, Research & Development, Human Resources). It helps HR teams identify key trends, employee demographics, and factors influencing attrition. The dashboards provide insights into employee count, attrition rate, average age, salary, tenure, education background, gender distribution, job roles, and salary slabs.
